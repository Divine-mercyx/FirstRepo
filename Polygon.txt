stage
prompt user to enter the number of sides on the polygon
collect the number of sides of polygon
store the number of sides on the polygon as n

prompt user to enter the length of one of the sides
collect the length of one of the sides
store the length of one of the sides as s

calculate for the area of a polygon by:

	(Math.pow((n * s), 2)) / (4 * (Math.tan(PI/n)))

store the result as area
display area

(n * s ^ 2) / (4 * tan(PI/n))
s = length
n number
