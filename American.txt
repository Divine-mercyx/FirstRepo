use a for loop to print:
for set counter to 1, if counter is less than 4, counter should be incremented by 1
inside the foor loop:
	display :
		"* * * * * * * * * = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ="
		" * * * * * * *  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ="
outside of the loop set another for loop
for set the z to 1, if z is less than 10, z should be incremented by 1
inside the for loop:
	display:
		"= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ="
